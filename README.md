# Assembler

The assembler takes in two files. One is an assembly file from the programmer at the command line. The other is a .DAT file that contains all the supported opcodes. The opcodes are read from the file and loaded into a table for storage. The instructions from the assembly file are also loaded into a table for use later when generating object code.

### *Current Work*
After loading data, it will generate object code that gets output as an object file. The object file could then be linked and loaded into memory.
